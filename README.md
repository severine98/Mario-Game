# Mario-Game
This game cannot be played on a phone as it requires the use of a keyboard.
The game starts as soon as the page loads, as the timer starts ticking. The player needs to fetch all 10 coins displayed on the page, using up/down/left/right arrow keys. Once all the coins have been caught, the time the player took to catch them is saved and 10 new coins instantly appear on the screen. The goal is to beat your previous time. There is also the possibility to reset the game.
 
## Purpose of this project
This project was developed in week 3 of the Web Development course. It allowed me to expand my JavaScript skills, and understand the use of coordinates and coalisation effects. It uses a mixture of functions and classes, which made me acknowledge the differences between these two ways of programming. This project was part of a challenge on the course: the instructions were to develop a JavaScript game in 5 days. The time limit meant that I had to carefully plan each step I was going to take prior to starting the code, by setting myself daily goals which allowed me to deliver the game on time with all the functionalities I intended to implement.
